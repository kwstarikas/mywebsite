            <p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy keeping up with the latest advancements in technology, 
                like what's the new JS framework or compiler shiped this week <span>&#128513;</span>.
                I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and eagerly embrace new challenges to expand my skill set.</p>
